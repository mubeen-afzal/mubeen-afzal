Research Intern at **CISPA Helmholtz Center**.

I am an **AI Engineer** turned **Security Researcher**, grounded in a **BS in AI** and **industry experience** building intelligent systems. My AI journey has involved developing complex architectures, including **fine-tuning LLMs**, engineering robust **RAG systems**, and designing **agentic AI workflows**.

My current work focuses at the critical intersection of AI and Cybersecurity. I specialize in two areas: I **protect AI models** from adversarial attacks, and I **leverage AI** to automate solutions for system defense and offense.

### 🔭 Research & Engineering Focus
* **AI-Driven Defense:** Leveraging LLMs and anomaly detection for automated threat intelligence and real-time log analysis.
* **AI-Driven Offense:** Designing agentic workflows for automated vulnerability scanning and red-teaming operations.
* **Securing AI:** Hardening models against evasion and poisoning attacks, ensuring robustness in Multi-Agent Systems (RAG).

### 💻 Technical Arsenal
